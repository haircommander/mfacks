What's the last lie you've told?
When's the last time you cried and why?
How long have you gone without showering?
What do you think is your biggest flaw?
What's one thing you'd change about yourself?
What's something that most people don't know about you?
Do you have a good relationship with your parents?
What's your family's dark secret?
What's the most number of drinks you've had within an hour?
When's the last time you smoked weed? Who were you with?
